					In 2022, I made the life changing decision to pursue the life of a
					developer by leaving my old career behind to pursue programming full
					time. Prior to this I was a digital marketer who specialised on
					platforms such as Amazon and working with SEO, so user experience and
					customer behaviours are nothing new to me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nowadays my love for code has taken over as I have really come to
					enjoy the constant sense of achievement that I feel as I continue to
					level up my skills. To me the ethos of lifelong learning is not just
					another career path but unlocks a new way to live which can also be
					applied to other areas of my life.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am not in fronnt of a computer I enjoy smoking meats, solving
					puzzles and reading (highly recommend Atomic Habits by James Clear)
