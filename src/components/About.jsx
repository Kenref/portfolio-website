					I am a <strong style={darkFont}>software developer</strong> who began
					my journey into the world of code in 2022. Prior to this I graduated
					with a{" "}
					<strong style={darkFont}>
						Bachelors of Business at Macquarie University

					. I was also a <strong style={darkFont}>digital marketer</strong> on
					platforms such as <strong style={darkFont}>Amazon</strong>,
					specialising in ad campaign creation and management, understanding
					customer behaviour and SEO.

				<p>
					Nowadays my love for programming has taken over as I enjoy the
					constant sense of achievement I feel in leveling up my skills.
					Discovering new concepts such as test driven development and SOLID
					really makes writing code feel like an artform as each will transform
					the way I write and think about code.

					When I am not in front of a computer I enjoy BBQ, playing chess and
					reading (highly recommend Atomic Habits by James Clear)
